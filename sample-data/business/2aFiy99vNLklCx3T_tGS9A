The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable. I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice.

Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more. \n\n-Rachel Charlupski\nFounder and CEO, The Babysitting Company", "useful" : 1, "funny" : 0, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }
