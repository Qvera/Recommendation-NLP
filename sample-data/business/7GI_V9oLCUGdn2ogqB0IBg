Personally I use them to purchase methanol for a water/meth injection kit I have in my car, and their prices are literally the lowest I've seen in the country for methanol.  Paid $3.49/gal today.  In addition to methanol, they sell every type of fuel, oil, lubricant you can imagine.  Race fuel, AvGas, E85.....etc\n\nAnd different from lots of other industrial-type places, everyone that works here is incredibly helpful and nice.", "useful" : 1, "funny" : 1, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }

I first came here to fuel up my old Mercedes on B99.  Even though I live in East Mesa, I would attempt to get there as often as possible, as they are the only place in the valley that will pump B99.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The only complaint I have is that their hours make it difficult for me to get fuel.  I understand this, however, as most of their business is from bulk specialty fuel sales, not B99 fill ups.  In response to Sara U, you really have nothing to worry about for getting 5 gallons of E85.  Your car is already running on 5-10% ethanol every time you fill up with unleaded.  I wouldn't do it on a regular basis, but it is not like you put diesel in a gas vehicle or vise versa.   Just fill up with regular unleaded, then have somebody clear your check engine light for you.  It will probably throw a code about the O2 sensor, not because it is broken, but because the oxygen content of the E85 is higher.  It shouldn't come back on.  And no, I don't work there.  I'm just a scientist who knows a thing or two about fuel!", "useful" : 0, "funny" : 0, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }

I called them to ask if they fuel up regular unleaded gas before going down there and they said yes. They need to inform their customers correctly and label their tanks in addition so it's obvious what they are actually putting into your vehicle. By the way Dave, they put UNLEADED REGULAR fuel (not biofuel) in my tank to dilute the E85 (duh) after they realized they made the mistake. My service engine light has now come on thanks to these idiots.\n\nYou obviously work there Dave. Get your facts right.", "useful" : 0, "funny" : 1, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }
