Unless of course you have a tiny waste and are maybe a size 0-4 on a good day. If you are looking for funky earrings, it might be worth a stop, but the majority of their earring inventory was kinda weird and a little too 80's inspired for my retro taste. If you are looking for stellar quality (and priced accordingly) funky retro furniture, then definitely pop in here as their selection is really cool and there were a ton of pieces that I easily would have purchased. As for the rest, I'd say hit this store up every once in again and see what they have to offer and if they start carrying bigger sizes in dresses, lemme know :)", "useful" : 5, "funny" : 5, "cool" : 4, "type" : "review" }

Sure, these are collectible pieces, goregous condition, the space is well cared for, I don't expect to afford these museum worthy pieces, especially at 11grand for a chair and ottoman (oh god, I hope the ottoman was included in that price....), but the affordable pieces of bracelets, earrings, clothing...um, it was a lot of the same items I saw here over a year ago...actually more like TWO years ago.....so, the inventory isn't very turnovering or fresh...so I guess Mint isn't so fresh?\n\nOverall, I was underwhelmed, I didn't feel particularly welcomed either time I was here, and the stock continues to center on polyster 70s clothing and BCBG tops (?) making an uneven style feel and chilly ambiance.  \n\nDefinitely not worth a stop.", "useful" : 3, "funny" : 4, "cool" : 1, "type" : "review" }

I almost teared up seeing a super cool crinoline like the one I had in high school.  (Yea, sometimes I was that girl.  We're moving on...)  Really great stuff.  A bit high priced, but not when you consider it's quality. Everything they had was great.  It didn't feel like estate sale shopping, ya know?\n\nThen there's the other 1/2 of the store that is an art gallery.  Somehow it just works.  Here the prices were extremely reasonable.  Some really great stuff too.  \n\nIt's behind much of the Roosevelt Row stops, just a bit behind Holgas.  Cool, yet approachable.", "useful" : 2, "funny" : 1, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }
