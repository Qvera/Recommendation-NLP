When I stopped in to pick them up they fit so well, I couldn't believe they were the same pair of pants.\n\nThe work was so good and the staff so friendly and professional that I went back into my closet and brought in more shirts.  It's so nice to have your clothes fit like they were made for you instead of sort of fitting in most places and not fitting at all in other places.

Waiting 2 hours for a food delivery order will do that to you.  \nI eat here often as the 16th street location is near my work.  The food is usually pretty good. If this were a dine-in only review I would probably give the place 3-4 stars.\nHowever this review also takes into account my one and only online delivery order and that brings the score down quite a bit.\nToday, I was stuck at work over my lunch break so I put in an online order for delivery.\nThe confirmation came back and said it would be 1 hour, which I thought was a long time since the sandwich takes 10 minutes and they are only 8 blocks away. (Jimmy Johns is right next door to them and they are usually here within 20 minutes, different restaurant, I know!)  Anyway, 1 hour came and went, then 1h30m, finally at 2 hours my food was delivered...or someone's food was delivered.  My sandwich was wrong (asked for no onions, got onions, asked for iced tea, got soda, asked for side of cheese wiz for my fries, got none).  The fries were cold and soggy also.\nI called the restaurant right away.  After talking to an employee for a few minutes, he gave up and transferred me to the manager.  He offered to remake the food and send it back out, but having already waited 2 hours I asked for a refund instead.  *long pause...okay, I'll refund your card.  I am giving back a star for the willingness to correct their mistake and refund me.\nSo long story short, dine in, don't get delivery, you will be much happier with your meal.", "useful" : 0, "funny" : 1, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }
