Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more. \n\n-Rachel Charlupski\nFounder and CEO, The Babysitting Company", "useful" : 1, "funny" : 0, "cool" : 0, "type" : "review" }
